# trader-scanner (Indian Market Edition)

The Chart Scanner is the first step of an Indian market day trade. It scans liquid
NSE-listed equities and indices, filtering out illiquid stocks and circuit-locked
names to find setups matching tested rules.

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` below is this skill's folder.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" universe       # -> downloads NSE Nifty 100 universe to trader/universe.txt
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" indices        # -> live benchmark snapshot (Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, VIX, Sensex)
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" daily          # before 09:15 IST: daily setups -> trader/watchlist.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" orb            # after 09:30 IST: 15-min Opening Range Breakouts -> trader/orb_candidates.json
